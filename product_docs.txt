SmartWidget Pro v4.2 — Product Docs

OVERVIEW

SmartWidget Pro is an API management and workflow automation platform for teams
that need to build, deploy, and monitor API-driven workflows. Rate limiting,
auth, analytics are all built in. We have about 12,000 enterprise customers
across 45 countries right now, handling roughly 2.3B API calls/month.


FEATURES

API Gateway
- REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket
- Auto-generates OpenAPI 3.1 specs from your deployed endpoints
- Request/response transformation with JSONPath expressions
- Rate limiting can be set per-user, per-key, per-endpoint, or globally
- Defaults: 1,000 req/min (Standard), 10,000 (Pro), 50,000 (Enterprise)
- Max request size: 10MB / 50MB / 256MB depending on plan
- SSL termination via Let's Encrypt or bring your own cert
- IP allowlisting/blocklisting (CIDR notation)

Workflow Engine
- Drag-and-drop builder, 150+ connectors out of the box
- Conditional branching, parallel paths (wait-all, wait-any, wait-n joins)
- Retry on failure: exponential backoff, configurable 1-10 retries, 1s-5m base delay
- Versioning with instant rollback
- Max execution time varies by plan: 15min / 60min / 24hrs
- Triggers: cron, fixed interval, or webhook
- Transform data between steps with Jinja2 or JS expressions

Auth & Security
- OAuth 2.0, SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect
- API key rotation on 30/60/90 day cycles
- RBAC with custom roles
- Audit logs kept 90 days (Standard), 1yr (Pro), 7yr (Enterprise)
- SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR
- AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- MFA required for admins
- SSO via Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin, PingIdentity

Monitoring
- Real-time dashboard, sub-second metrics
- PromQL-compatible custom metrics
- Alerts go to email, Slack, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, or webhooks
- Usage reports (daily/weekly/monthly), exportable as CSV or PDF
- ML-based anomaly detection for traffic spikes
- Error tracking with grouping and root cause suggestions
- P50/P90/P95/P99 latency tracking per endpoint
- Geographic distribution heatmap for API consumers

Dev Experience
- SDKs: Python, JS/TS, Go, Java, Ruby, PHP, Rust
- API explorer with code samples
- Local dev proxy for testing against prod-like environment
- Git-based config management, PR-based deployments
- CLI tool (swctl) for scripting and CI/CD
- Terraform and Pulumi providers

Known Limitations (as of v4.2)
- WebSocket connections cap at 10,000 concurrent per account on Standard
- Workflow builder doesn't support loops natively — use recursive webhook triggers as workaround
- GraphQL subscriptions only work with the Pro plan and above
- Batch API (/v4/batch) limited to 500 operations per request
- Custom metrics retention: 30 days on Standard, 90 days on Pro, 1yr on Enterprise
- Workflow step timeout minimum is 5 seconds, can't go lower
- File upload in workflow steps maxes out at 100MB regardless of plan
- The Rust SDK is still in beta, some endpoints missing (check changelog)

INTEGRATION

Getting started:
1. Sign up at https://app.smartwidget.io/signup
2. Go to Settings > API Keys, create a key
3. Install SDK — pip install smartwidget-sdk or npm install @smartwidget/sdk
4. Init the client with your key and make a call

Auth header format:
  Authorization: Bearer sw_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Test keys start with sw_test_, live keys with sw_live_.
Don't put live keys in client-side code or public repos.

Rate limit responses (HTTP 429):
  X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
  X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
  X-RateLimit-Reset: 1708300800
  Retry-After: 32
Use exponential backoff, start at 1s, max 5 retries.

Webhooks — configure at Settings > Webhooks
Events: workflow.completed, workflow.failed, workflow.timeout,
        api.error, api.rate_limited,
        user.created, user.updated, user.deleted,
        billing.invoice.created, billing.payment.failed
Payloads signed with HMAC-SHA256 (verify with your webhook secret).
Delivery timeout 30s, retries 3x with backoff.

Migrating from v3.x to v4.2:
  - Auth header: X-API-Key is now Authorization: Bearer
  - Rate limit headers: X-Rate-Limit-* renamed to X-RateLimit-*
  - Webhook payloads changed from flat to nested JSON
  - Execution endpoint: /v3/execute -> /v4/workflows/run
  Run: swctl migrate --from v3 --to v4 --dry-run


TROUBLESHOOTING

Common errors:
  401 — bad or expired API key, regenerate in Settings
  403 — wrong permissions, check your RBAC roles
  429 — rate limited, back off and retry
  502 — upstream timeout, bump your workflow step timeouts
  503 — we're down, check status.smartwidget.io

Connection problems:
  - Make sure port 443 outbound is open to *.smartwidget.io
  - Behind a proxy? Set it in SDK: SmartWidget(proxy="http://proxy:8080")
  - WebSocket needs WSS on 443
  - DNS issues: try 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1

Performance tips:
  - Connection pooling: max_connections=25
  - Compression: send Accept-Encoding: gzip
  - Paginate list calls (default 50, max 200)
  - Use ETags for caching GET responses
  - Bulk ops: use /v4/batch instead of individual calls
  - If latency matters, deploy to the region closest to your users
  - For high-throughput: request a rate limit increase via support ticket
    (takes 1-2 business days, need to justify the volume)

Common integration mistakes:
  - Using test keys (sw_test_) in production — you'll get sandbox data back
  - Not handling pagination — default page size is 50, if you have more records
    you'll silently miss them
  - Hardcoding webhook URLs — use config or env vars so staging/prod don't cross
  - Ignoring Retry-After header on 429s — just sleeping a fixed 1s won't work
    under sustained load, read the header value
  - Forgetting to verify webhook signatures — anyone can POST to your endpoint
    if it's public


SLA & SUPPORT

Uptime guarantees:
  Standard  — 99.5%
  Pro       — 99.9%
  Enterprise — 99.99% (financial credits if violated)

Support channels:
  Standard: email only, 48hr response, community forum
  Pro: email + chat, 4hr response, phone during business hours
  Enterprise: 24/7 phone + email + chat, 1hr response, dedicated Slack channel,
              quarterly business reviews

Escalation path: if your ticket isn't resolved within the SLA window,
reply with "ESCALATE" in the subject and it goes to a senior engineer.
Enterprise customers can also page their dedicated account manager directly.
